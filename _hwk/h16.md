<li> Compilers/interpreters are often divided into three phases: tokeniztion, parsing, and interpretation.   Briefly describe the main "job" of each of these phases, in terms of its "input" and "output.

(10 pts) The phrase *code smell* is used by some software developers to refer to things in "other people's code" that suggest that the code may have some problems, and needs to be refactored.

Long sequences of if/else statements that use `instanceof` are often considered to be a so-called *code smell*.   For example, the code in the box at right.

Please give at least two reasons that this style of code is not desirable, as compared to some of the available alternatives.

For each of the ASTs shown below (a, b, and c), give an arithmetic expression that would result in this tree.  Parentheses may be used.  Note that there may be more than one correct answer.

(20 pts) In your own words, how does an AST capture the idea of operator precedence?
